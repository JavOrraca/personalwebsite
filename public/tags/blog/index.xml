      <description>For my University of California, Irvine, MSBA classmates&amp;hellip; I‚Äôve been blown away by the presentations you‚Äôve given the last few days and humbled by your aptitude for data analytics! Just one more week (of finals! üòÖ)&amp;hellip; we got this!
My team used Python to web-scrape Marvel Cinematic Universe movie rating and financial data since the release of Iron Man (2008). The goal was to predict the US Box Office revenues for Avengers: End Game given ratings, budget, and revenue patterns of all the recent Marvel movies.</description>

      <description>I only started learning Python in January but regularly use Jupyter Notebooks for all of my R-based projects. Last week, I discovered Google Colab&amp;hellip; After spending 24-32 hours on it, I might be in love!
Colab is free, Google cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment for team collaboration. No installs required. Just send your teammates a URL and you&amp;rsquo;re set! Give it a shot with uploading your own Jupyter ipynb files (or see link below).</description>

      <description>If you‚Äôre based in SoCal, I highly recommend a visit to the Telestron installation (Feb 23 - March 28). This is an immersive, futuristic light show put on by VTProDesign and GMUNK. I love the intersection of art+technology and these robots do not disappoint!

      <description>Tableau&amp;rsquo;s latest upgrade has a native natural language processing capability called Ask Data - Ask it a question in plain English (&amp;ldquo;What is the profit over time, by business line?&amp;rdquo;) and Tableau &amp;ldquo;determines the most appropriate visualization to satisfy the user‚Äôs intent.&amp;rdquo; Super neat, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to give the upgrade a spin!
On the surface, Ask Data seems gimmicky&amp;hellip; But as a starting point for visualizations, or for near-instant data investigation during a meeting, this is an awesome feature.</description>

      <description>I saw Ben Taylor present a few months back and was blown away. He&amp;rsquo;s continuously researching and educating himself, pushing the limits of deep learning, and he&amp;rsquo;s an advocate of side projects as a vehicle for growth (as am I!). Ben is super passionate about data science, harnessing computational power from GPU/CUDA systems, and his work with generative adversarial networks (GANs) is next level&amp;hellip;

      <description>Super excited with the interviews I&amp;rsquo;ve been recording recently for Scatter Podcast (LAUNCHING SOON)! There are so many great data science podcasts that I regularly enjoy, I&amp;rsquo;m just hoping to offer a slightly different angle. I want to explore and share what &amp;ldquo;data science&amp;rdquo; means at different companies, what day-to-day life is like within those teams, and better understand what experiences and skills certain companies value for potential candidates in their analytics, insights, and data science roles.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago, I knew nothing about the NFL (despite my passion for f√∫tbol!). I teamed up with my classmate and knowledgeable NFL fan, Kaitlyn Drake, and developed a model and game simulation via R to predict the Super Bowl winner and final scores. We predicted the Rams winning 15-14‚Ä¶ it‚Äôll be a close game. We relied on Poisson regression, game simulation, and C4.5 / J48 decision tree to derive our results.</description>

      <description>I joined LinkedIn&amp;rsquo;s Career Advice beta program and have been providing career and interview tips to students and professionals wanting a career change since 2017. Since several students have found my feedback helpful, I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll welcome this unsolicited feedback. Now that I&amp;rsquo;m back in graduate school, it&amp;rsquo;s also a nice reminder for myself as we approach &amp;ldquo;interview season.&amp;rdquo; For some context, I&amp;rsquo;ve never had HR or Recruiter titles, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate to have had many opportunities to interview college students and experienced professionals at EY, PG&amp;amp;E, and KPMG.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in data science, machine learning, and adding business value through data-driven decision making, I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to chat about my experiences so far at the University of California, Irvine. The Paul Merage School of Business did a student profile on me about why I chose the MS in Business Analytics program. UCI placed my profile alongside an overview of the program&amp;rsquo;s curriculum and capstone projects (both of which were key factors for selecting UCI over other universities).</description>

Great stuff&amp;hellip; I just tried out The Grand Budapest Hotel palette for a correlation matrix (see above)!
Props to my classmate Kaitlyn Drake for finding this gem!

      <description>Network visualizations can be useful for understanding entity and large data interdependencies. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using R and the iGraph package to explore network analysis and found this tutorial to be EXCELLENT by Katherine Ognyanova. It takes a lot of time to build these network graphs and more time to interpret, but definitely rewarding when it provides insights you may have otherwise overlooked. The screenshot above is a network diagram that I made to represent Amazon product copurchases.</description>

As promised, I wanted to share useful resources that I learned of at DSGO. Below I&amp;rsquo;m presenting my favorites, by presenter.

      <description>Machine learning via R, Python, (enter your tool of choice here)&amp;hellip; Not bad. But doing machine learning by hand, wow&amp;hellip; This is a true study of patience!
For a school assignment, we had to deconstruct a supervised machine learning model (Naive Bayes) using one data set for training and another for testing, all by hand. This was definitely rewarding being able to understand the depth of conditional probabilities in this classifier model.</description>
