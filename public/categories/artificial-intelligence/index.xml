      <description>I saw Ben Taylor present a few months back and was blown away. He&amp;rsquo;s continuously researching and educating himself, pushing the limits of deep learning, and he&amp;rsquo;s an advocate of side projects as a vehicle for growth (as am I!). Ben is super passionate about data science, harnessing computational power from GPU/CUDA systems, and his work with generative adversarial networks (GANs) is next level&amp;hellip;

      <description>Building and training ML models takes a ton of time. Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Azure can now automate several steps in your AI development process including &amp;ldquo;data transformation, model selection and hyperparameter tuning.&amp;rdquo; Really impressed that Azure is making this tech more accessible and easier to use. If you have hands-on work experience with Azure and don&amp;rsquo;t mind me asking you some questions, please message me, thanks!
