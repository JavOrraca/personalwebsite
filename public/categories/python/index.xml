      <description>I only started learning Python in January but regularly use Jupyter Notebooks for all of my R-based projects. Last week, I discovered Google Colab&amp;hellip; After spending 24-32 hours on it, I might be in love!
Colab is free, Google cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment for team collaboration. No installs required. Just send your teammates a URL and you&amp;rsquo;re set! Give it a shot with uploading your own Jupyter ipynb files (or see link below).</description>
