      <description>For my University of California, Irvine, MSBA classmates&amp;hellip; Iâ€™ve been blown away by the presentations youâ€™ve given the last few days and humbled by your aptitude for data analytics! Just one more week (of finals! ðŸ˜…)&amp;hellip; we got this!
My team used Python to web-scrape Marvel Cinematic Universe movie rating and financial data since the release of Iron Man (2008). The goal was to predict the US Box Office revenues for Avengers: End Game given ratings, budget, and revenue patterns of all the recent Marvel movies.</description>

      <description>Interested in an instructor led Python crash course? I&amp;rsquo;m a board member for UCI&amp;rsquo;s Merage Analytics Club and we&amp;rsquo;re hosting a 1.5 hour Python for Business training led by my classmate and extremely talented programmer and data storyteller, Samira Kumar Varadharajan.
We&amp;rsquo;ll be walking through Jupyter Notebook and providing an introduction to the following: 1. Basic Python libraries 2. Better visualizations in Python 3. Machine learning via Scikit-Learn
This event is open to all (students and non-students), is free for MSA members, and only costs 5 bucks for nonmembers.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in data science, machine learning, and adding business value through data-driven decision making, I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to chat about my experiences so far at the University of California, Irvine. The Paul Merage School of Business did a student profile on me about why I chose the MS in Business Analytics program. UCI placed my profile alongside an overview of the program&amp;rsquo;s curriculum and capstone projects (both of which were key factors for selecting UCI over other universities).</description>
