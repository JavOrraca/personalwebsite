      <description>Super excited with the interviews I&amp;rsquo;ve been recording recently for Scatter Podcast (LAUNCHING SOON)! There are so many great data science podcasts that I regularly enjoy, I&amp;rsquo;m just hoping to offer a slightly different angle. I want to explore and share what &amp;ldquo;data science&amp;rdquo; means at different companies, what day-to-day life is like within those teams, and better understand what experiences and skills certain companies value for potential candidates in their analytics, insights, and data science roles.</description>

      <description>Netflix uses R and Python for machine learning and predictive modeling to support content recommendations and FAST delivery of content. On the We Are Netflix podcast series, Netflix has done an amazing job interviewing their data scientists and explaining how machine learning is enhancing the Netflix experience.
