      <description>I joined LinkedIn&amp;rsquo;s Career Advice beta program and have been providing career and interview tips to students and professionals wanting a career change since 2017. Since several students have found my feedback helpful, I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll welcome this unsolicited feedback. Now that I&amp;rsquo;m back in graduate school, it&amp;rsquo;s also a nice reminder for myself as we approach &amp;ldquo;interview season.&amp;rdquo; For some context, I&amp;rsquo;ve never had HR or Recruiter titles, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate to have had many opportunities to interview college students and experienced professionals at EY, PG&amp;amp;E, and KPMG.</description>
