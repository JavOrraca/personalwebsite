      <description>I saw Ben Taylor present a few months back and was blown away. He&amp;rsquo;s continuously researching and educating himself, pushing the limits of deep learning, and he&amp;rsquo;s an advocate of side projects as a vehicle for growth (as am I!). Ben is super passionate about data science, harnessing computational power from GPU/CUDA systems, and his work with generative adversarial networks (GANs) is next level&amp;hellip;
The image above is an AI-produced synthetic face made possible through GANs.</description>
