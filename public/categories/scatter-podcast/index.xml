      <description>New episode of Scatter Podcast is online with Rafi Kurlansik of Databricks. Rafi has great perspective given his unique opportunities as a data scientist within tech sales and pre-sales teams. He also shares some great resources if youâ€™re interested in learning Databricks, a cloud-based unified analytics platform. Happy Monday!

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m really excited to announce that Scatter Podcast is finally live (available on most music and podcast streaming platforms)! The first four episodes include a podcast intro and three episodes with engaging guests from The Home Depot, Pacific Life, and NYC &amp;amp; Company.
I plan to release one episode weekly - Look out for upcoming interviews with data science reps from T-Mobile, Databricks, KPMG, Chegg, Technossus, Levi Strauss, Google, TensorIoT, and more!</description>

      <description>Super excited with the interviews I&amp;rsquo;ve been recording recently for Scatter Podcast (LAUNCHING SOON)! There are so many great data science podcasts that I regularly enjoy, I&amp;rsquo;m just hoping to offer a slightly different angle. I want to explore and share what &amp;ldquo;data science&amp;rdquo; means at different companies, what day-to-day life is like within those teams, and better understand what experiences and skills certain companies value for potential candidates in their analytics, insights, and data science roles.</description>
