<p>My name is Javier Orraca and I drive business value for corporations and privately held businesses through data analytics, predictive modeling, and empowering stakeholders with robust decision analytics.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>My career includes over a decade of consulting, data analysis, and fixed asset valuation modeling for Ernst &amp; Young (EY), Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E), and KPMG. My work supported M&amp;A financial reporting requirements and strategic finance initiatives. I had a vision of providing <em>more</em> value to business organizations than what my M&amp;A and valuation work allowed for, so I began to explore and learn how to apply regressions and machine learning for advanced, data-driven decision making.</p>

<p>Finding a new passion in analytics and data science, I pursued a Business Analytics graduate degree at the University of California, Irvine, and graduated in 2019. Throughout my graduate program, I leveraged my data and financial modeling experiences to help financial services firms, creative advertising agencies, and several retail businesses. I developed a commercial AI product for financial modelers, and am currently available for analytics consulting opportunities. If you are interested in partnering on a commercial product or want to learn more about my analytics service offerings, please contact me for a free consultation.</p>

<h2 id="web-development">Web Development</h2>

<p>I am not a web developer but I created this website using the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> programming language, <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a>, and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. My site renders in less than 100ms and I&rsquo;m hosting it for <em>free</em>&hellip; It only cost me time and $15/year for the domain name. Open-source tools are fast, flexible, fun, and paving the future of analytics.</p>
