      <description>On Episode 026 of Scatter Podcast, I interviewed guest Jonathan Regenstein, Director of Financial Services at RStudio. Having spent several years at J.P. Morgan where he worked alongside quantitative analysts and researchers, Jonathan turned from Excel to R for more robust reporting, visualizations, and reproducibility of financial models. After joining RStudio, he continued to develop his R programming skills and eventually authored &amp;ldquo;Reproducible Finance with R - Code Flows and Shiny Apps for Portfolio Analysis.</description>

      <description>Pablo Barajas, a friend and recent graduate with me at UC Irvine, led a presentation on how to build a website using R, RStudio, and Blogdown. For anyone wanting to fairly easily build an online portfolio or blog that looks professional, I highly recommend Blogdown. I used this process to build this website, as did Pablo for his personal website, and I can help if you have any questions. Here&amp;rsquo;s the process in short: RStudio site build with Blogdown -&amp;gt; Commit to GitHub -&amp;gt; Apply Hugo theme -&amp;gt; Netlify for CI/CD</description>

      <description>If you use R but aren&amp;rsquo;t using R Markdown, you should be. It&amp;rsquo;s such a great way to make reports come to life. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it more in the last month than I have in the last year and can&amp;rsquo;t believe how much more interactive I&amp;rsquo;ve made my deliverables (and even my own data exploration). Really excited to see what new tricks I can learn from RStudio&amp;rsquo;s webinar on Friday, November 15!</description>

      <description>Updated: October 2019 Note: Python online learning recommendations need updating. The Python books are still highly recommended.
Below are data science resources to point you in the right direction for learning more about data analytics, data science, and programming. I&amp;rsquo;ll update the list periodically as I learn of new resources and tools. R, Python, and SQL are programming languages used for data collection, data manipulation, data analytics, statistical analysis, web scraping, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <description>It pains me to share a Medium article of any kind these days because the bane of my existence is reaching my Medium article limit on the first day of the month (#EndRant). The BBC News data science and visualization team published this great overview on their lessons learned after using R for visualizations over the course of 1.5 years.
Great read, AND super neat to see the BBC team open-source their BBPLOT and R Cookbook to help streamline your visualization workflows, reduce manual repetition of code setup for a ggplot2 viz, and to educate you on better storytelling approaches with R.</description>

      <description>Every once in a blue moon when I log into Twitter, I&amp;rsquo;ll come across some gems that excite me&amp;hellip; Such was the case this morning when I learned that Hadley Wickham of RStudio is writing a book called &amp;ldquo;Mastering Shiny,&amp;rdquo; expected for publication in late 2020 by O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Media.
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in a free resource for learning how to develop R Shiny web apps, the first few chapters of &amp;ldquo;Mastering Shiny&amp;rdquo; are online (in development) full of code samples to follow.</description>

      <description>Data Science GO (&amp;ldquo;DSGO&amp;rdquo;) was a huge success. It was great to reconnect with data science practitioners and leaders that I met at DSGO 2018, and to learn about the latest trends and how much the space has changed in just one year. I felt a lot of pride seeing UCI&amp;rsquo;s MS in Business Analytics (&amp;ldquo;MSBA&amp;rdquo;) program as the main educational sponsor for the event, and I also enjoyed seeing my old professor, Sanjeev Dewan, talk on the main stage about causal inference methods in data science (that&amp;rsquo;s him in the picture, above)!</description>

      <description>TensorFlow 2.0 is finally alpha-released. I use Python and R but tend to focus on R these days. So, what changes should R users be aware of? The RStudio team wrote a thorough post on the subject, providing a tour of the new r-tensorflow ecosystem, with code samples.
The good news? If you&amp;rsquo;ve been using TensorFlow within keras, like me, syntactically almost everything remains the same. You&amp;rsquo;ll notice very few differences, if any.</description>

      <description>As a starting point for tackling data analysis problems, I often start from the perspective of &amp;ldquo;how would I have done this in Excel, if even possible?&amp;rdquo; This is what happens when you&amp;rsquo;ve spent the bulk of your career knee-deep in Excel and then you shift to more advanced data science tools like Python and R.
I love good reference books and one that I keep on my bookshelf is Beyond Spreadsheets with R, by Dr.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent weeks slowly (and patiently) learning how to build and deploy Docker containers&amp;hellip; All was good, just dense for beginners. I was elated to find an easier approach to 1) building a Docker image with all the necessary packages / dependencies that you need, and 2) deploying an interactive web notebook (using a RStudio or Jupyter interface).
Some setup is involved, granted, the process is significantly streamlined with Binder. There is one main caveat here - Your data must be on a GitHub repo.</description>

      <description>Anomaly and outlier detection&amp;hellip; Neat, advanced stuff in this space that I finally got my hands dirty with in R. The anomalize package, created by Matt Dancho, helped me identify outliers and smooth out my forecasting model (backtesting also improved). I used anomalize in conjunction with Facebook&amp;rsquo;s prophet for a time-series projection. For R users out there: This package works beautifully with the tidyverse.
I&amp;rsquo;m continuously impressed by the stuff that Matt puts out including educational content, tutorials, webinars, and his package development.</description>

      <description>Design thinking is being talked about a lot more these days. It is an iterative, problem-solving approach that helps new solutions come to light that aren&amp;rsquo;t always apparent at first glance. Design thinking is not a new concept, designers have used it for years, and it can be used in all aspects of business to conceptualize alternative strategies or to justify your original solution.
Most recently, design thinking has been championed by leading data scientists (and non-technical professionals) given the benefits of applying a scientific method to solving business problems.</description>

      <description>Python users: pip install plotly==4.0.0
Definitely excited to use the updated Plotly.py. This shift to offline-only is amazing. It &amp;ldquo;requires no internet connection, no account, no authentication tokens, and no payment of any kind.&amp;rdquo; Great stuff here, and now Plotly Express comes built in to make interactive plot making even easier&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;plotly.express is to plotly what seaborn is to matplotlib&amp;rdquo;
For you Jupyter and Colab fans, rendering Plotly figures to these notebooks (and other IDEs) should now feel a lot less clunky.</description>

      <description>Here are a few tips, learned the hard way, for Linux beginners, data science students, or practitioners wanting to use Linux for machine learning and AI:
1) If you plan on dual-booting with Windows, there is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Setting up your Windows and BIOS settings to allow for disk partitions and Linux dual-boot can be manufacturer and/or Windows-version specific. I have a Lenovo ThinkPad and I am running pre-installed Windows 10 Professional&amp;hellip; If you have a similar system and looking to dual-boot, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to help with Ubuntu.</description>

      <description>I came across this meme today and it cracked me up&amp;hellip; There&amp;rsquo;s a big difference between lying on your resume and embellishing (I&amp;rsquo;ve written about this before, but even with embellishing, there is a line that you can easily cross). But folks&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t lie about your experience on your resume. It&amp;rsquo;s not good for you or your employer (if they fall for your lies), and definitely not good for your reputation if you get into something way over your head.</description>

Meltem&amp;rsquo;s deep analytical and data science expertise developed over her 20 years of experience in academia, consulting, and the corporate world. In fact, before &amp;ldquo;data science&amp;rdquo; became a catchphrase, Meltem was referred to as an algorithm developer.
At GM, Meltem&amp;rsquo;s team aims to enhance the driver experience where she applies neuroscience theory to analyze massive data sets via machine learning and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a super useful and easy approach, with sample code, for exporting R ggplot2 plots to PowerPoint as geometric shapes (vector objects). Using the officer R package, you&amp;rsquo;re able to edit the styling of your plots directly in PowerPoint to match your presentation theme or change to your liking. This also works on LibreOffice for Linux distributions.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve previously posted about the benefits of the dplyr package for data manipulation and performing if/else functions, but I wanted to share this R-bloggers post by Markus Berroth. The post includes base R vs dplyr sample code to demonstrate how dplyr can make life easier for data scientists. The Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) illustrations are also super helpful for understanding what&amp;rsquo;s happening with your R code.
These type of AST visuals are all over Hadley Wickham&amp;rsquo;s Advanced R (Second Edition), and they&amp;rsquo;ve definitely helped me to better understand my R code.</description>

      <description>Rahul Agarwal recently wrote an article for Towards Data Science that provides a great overview on the history of MapReduce, Spark, and using Python / PySpark for data engineering. I worked on a project recently with two people and we were shocked at how computationally efficient Spark was for our use case. We were able to load, read, manipulate, and explore over 30 GB of data in a Google Colab, GPU-enabled environment without reaching Google&amp;rsquo;s RAM limitation&amp;hellip; If you&amp;rsquo;ve used Colab, you know that you can eat through 12 GB of GPU RAM quickly.</description>

For my old co-workers in valuation, financial modeling, and corporate finance, I urge all of you to learn the R programming language. I assure you that you&amp;rsquo;ll still use Excel (often), but from a reproducibility perspective for your complex recurring analyses and forecasts, R is a better solution for you.</description>

      <description>Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) can be phenomenal for processing deep learning models in the cloud, but there&amp;rsquo;s a catch - especially if you&amp;rsquo;re a student or enthusiast with no corporate account access - These cloud tools get expensive! For $1-3 per hour, you can cloud compute using AWS or GCP&amp;hellip; Not bad! But if you want extended access to your cloud instances, or 24&amp;frasl;7 access as I&amp;rsquo;d like to have, cloud solutions become cost prohibitive.</description>

      <description>In May 2018, Harvard Business Review published a report (links below) titled &amp;ldquo;Why Marketing Analytics Hasn&amp;rsquo;t Lived Up to Its Promise.&amp;rdquo; My most recent Scatter Podcast guest, Ryan Anderson, wrote a critique of the HBR article that helps frame the conversation in another light: marketing analytics ALONE is not the solution.
We talked about the HBR piece and Ryan&amp;rsquo;s response on this week&amp;rsquo;s podcast release, but being that Ryan has made a career in strategic marketing and web analytics, I&amp;rsquo;d definitely recommend you read both of these articles if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in this line of work!</description>

      <description>In mid-March, I worked with a team of UC Irvine students to analyze the Marvel Cinematic Universe and predict US box office revenues for Avengers: Endgame. We estimated US box office revenues to be $639 million and as of today, domestic box office revenues are $645 million!
To my UC Irvine teammates (Ahnni, Daria, Joel, Xiaoting)&amp;hellip; Great job! At the time that we developed our predictions, Captain Marvel had only been in theaters for one week&amp;hellip; I just updated our models and our new domestic box office prediction for Endgame is $670 million.</description>

      <description>Git, GitHub, and distributed version control can make your statistical and data science workflows so much cleaner, more organized, and perfect for collaborative projects. This is a topic that I&amp;rsquo;m just now researching and can&amp;rsquo;t believe that I waited this long to do.
In finance, I was accustomed to saving numerous files per day (adding the date and version to the end of the model filename). Git and GitHub have a learning curve and require effort - I&amp;rsquo;m learning this now and can attest to you needing patience - But, the beauty of this data management process is that instead of saving one file only, you &amp;ldquo;commit&amp;rdquo; or save a multi-file snapshot of your entire project to the cloud!</description>

      <description>Personalized LinkedIn requests CAN be sent through the mobile app&amp;hellip; I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize this until today, but the key is to avoid hitting Connect when you’re shown a list of recommended contacts (this will send out a boilerplate request message). Instead, navigate to the contact’s LinkedIn profile and from there, you have access to personalize your request note! Thanks to Kate Strachnyi for her live stream today and her candid advice is always appreciated.</description>

      <description>When working with data sets of significant size, I&amp;rsquo;m always on the lookout for more efficient code (not necessarily fewer lines of code, but code that processes data faster and more effectively). Recently, I was getting antsy waiting for a simple if/else statement to run via R (I was working with a large GB-sized file on my personal computer). While waiting, I researched alternative approaches for performance improvement and found that dplyr, part of R&amp;rsquo;s Tidyverse and one of my favorite packages for data manipulation, has a vectorized if function perfect for the occasion.</description>

Turns out, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; for my system to throttle the CPU at 1.9 GHz. Using ThrottleStop (free), I removed CPU throttling for speed gains and undervolted the CPU/cache/GPU for temperature control. I&amp;rsquo;m running stable at ~3.</description>

      <description>Network visualizations can be useful for understanding entity and large data interdependencies. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using R and the iGraph package to explore network analysis and found this tutorial to be EXCELLENT by Katherine Ognyanova. It takes a lot of time to build these network graphs and more time to interpret, but definitely rewarding when it provides insights you may have otherwise overlooked. The screenshot above is a network diagram that I made to represent Amazon product copurchases.</description>

      <description>Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few weeks to digest my experience at DataScienceGO 2018, definitely one for the books. I especially enjoyed making so many connections and absorbing (or rather, writing-a-million-miles-an-hour) so much knowledge over a short weekend. As promised, I wanted to share useful resources that I learned of at DSGO. Below I&amp;rsquo;m presenting my favorites, by presenter.

      <description>Machine learning via R, Python, (enter your tool of choice here)&amp;hellip; Not bad. But doing machine learning by hand, wow&amp;hellip; This is a true study of patience!
For a school assignment, we had to deconstruct a supervised machine learning model (Naive Bayes) using one data set for training and another for testing, all by hand. This was definitely rewarding being able to understand the depth of conditional probabilities in this classifier model.</description>

      <description>First quarter of grad school is finally over! Now with some free time, I finally learned Git (for BASH emulation), set up a GitHub account, and looking forward to collaborating on analytics projects. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in R or machine learning, one of my projects is a basic ML exercise that relies on the k-means algorithm for clustering.

      <description>Microsoft Excel&amp;rsquo;s pivot tables and Google Maps&amp;hellip; Obvious differences here, but both are driven by split-apply-combine methodologies that visualize data sets. If you want to learn how to make a pivot table &amp;ldquo;from scratch,&amp;rdquo; or enhance your analytics capabilities beyond Excel, learn R (or Python) as a starting point. R is an analytics and graphics programming language that is free, fun, and an interactive way to learn the R basics is via swirl.</description>

      <guid>/about/</guid>
      <description>My name is Javier Orraca and I drive business value for corporations and privately held businesses through data, predictive modeling, and empowering stakeholders with robust decision analytics.
Background My career includes over a decade of consulting, data analysis, and fixed asset valuation modeling for Ernst &amp;amp; Young (EY), Pacific Gas &amp;amp; Electric (PG&amp;amp;E), and KPMG. My work supported M&amp;amp;A financial reporting requirements and strategic finance initiatives. I had a vision of providing more value to business organizations than what my M&amp;amp;A and valuation work allowed for, so I began to explore and learn how to apply regressions and machine learning for advanced, data-driven decision making.</description>
