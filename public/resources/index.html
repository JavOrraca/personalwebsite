<p><strong>Books</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Eremenko, Kirill. <em>Confident Data Skills: Master the Fundamentals of Working with Data and Supercharge Your Career</em>. Kogan Page, 2018.</p>

<ul>
<li>From the creator of Super Data Science, this was an easy &ldquo;for fun&rdquo; read, light math, and provides an overview of data analytics and careers in this field. I swear I&rsquo;m not on Kirill&rsquo;s payroll(!)&hellip; he&rsquo;s just a data science career guru with fresh perspectives. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0749481544/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=superdatascie-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0749481544&amp;linkId=bb7507851a740c1eb7f45ab4b6bd2a84">Amazon link</a></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Provost, Foster and Fawcett, Tom. <em>Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know About Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking</em>. O&rsquo;Reilly Media, Inc., 2013.</p>

<ul>
<li>This was a textbook for Foundations of Data Science, an UCI graduate course that I recently completed. Examples in this textbook are denser and math-heavier than <em>Confident Data Skills</em>. This would be most appropriate for anyone actively trying to move into a data science role. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Business-Data-Analytic-Thinking/dp/1449361323/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1537984955&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=data+science+for+business">Amazon link</a></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>O&rsquo;Neil, Cathy. <em>Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy</em>. Crown Publishing, 2016.</p>

<ul>
<li>O&rsquo;Neil argues that the predictive algorithms being used today are opaque, unregulated, and uncontestable, even when they’re wrong. She builds upon her career experiences as a Quantitative Engineer and aims to educate data scienctists about how to take more responsibility for their algorithms. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality/dp/0553418815">Amazon link</a></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Murray, Scott. <em>Interactive Data Visualization for the Web: An Introduction to Designing with D3</em>. O&rsquo;Reilly Media, Inc., 2nd Edition, 2017.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ideal for beginners, Scott Murray takes you through easy-to-consume fundamental concepts and methods of D3, the most powerful JavaScript library for web-based visualizations. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Interactive-Data-Visualization-Web-Introduction/dp/1491921285">Amazon link</a></li>
<li><em>Note: This 2nd Edition (October 2017) release was updated with D3&rsquo;s v4 syntax and D3 v5 was released in April 2018. While some of the syntax in this 2nd Edition may be rendered obsolete, it&rsquo;s still a valuable resource for learning the fundamentals of D3 and data design.</em></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Abbott, Dean. <em>Applied Predictive Analytics</em>. Wiley, 2014.</p>

<ul>
<li>This book is ideal for tech-savvy business and data analysts, and serves as a solid bridge between academia and professional scenarios. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Predictive-Analytics-Dean-Abbott/dp/1118727967/ref=sr_1_1?crid=NMRPT6BR2NLS&amp;keywords=applied+predictive+analytics&amp;qid=1553226294&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=applied+predict%2Caps%2C227&amp;sr=8-1">Amazon link</a></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Burkov, Andriy. <em>The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book</em>. Andriy Burkov, 2019.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is one of my favorite reference books. It is best suited for beginners already comfortable with analytics terminology. In the author&rsquo;s words, this is an &ldquo;attempt to write an easy-to-read book on machine learning that isn&rsquo;t afraid of using math,&rdquo; and it is &ldquo;also the first attempt to squeeze a wide range of machine learning topics in a systematic way and without loss in quality.&rdquo;</li>
<li>If you know the basics of R or Python and want to push your predictive modeling and ML education to the next level, you&rsquo;ll love how succinct this book is. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hundred-Page-Machine-Learning-Book/dp/199957950X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1554174838&amp;sr=8-2">Amazon link</a></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Foreman, John. <em>Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight</em>. Wiley, 2013.</p>

<ul>
<li>Contrary to popular belief (<em>especially among us data folks</em>), not every problem is a big data problem that requires programming via R or Python. This book explores the full capabilities of Excel for data science, and does a great job at it. Espcially for Excel power users, this book would be a first great step before plunging into R or Python (or vice versa, perhaps you&rsquo;re an avid R user that barely knows Excel&hellip; this book would be great for you too). <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Smart-Science-Transform-Information/dp/111866146X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=data+smart&amp;qid=1553226341&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1">Amazon link</a></li>
</ul></li>

<p><strong>R: The Basics</strong>
* <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">RStudio</a>: To get started with R, download and install RStudio&rsquo;s open-source desktop IDE
* <a href="https://swirlstats.com/students.html">swirl</a>: Once RStudio is installed (or your IDE of choice), installing the swirl package is as easy as typing <em>install.packages(&ldquo;swirl&rdquo;)</em> in the RStudio console
  * This R package includes 15 interactive lessons (about 30 minutes each) that teach you the fundamentals of R programming and the data structures
* <a href="https://www.rforexcelusers.com/">R for Excel Users</a>: Pivoting from a financial modeling background to data science, this blog was helpful in understanding how to do common &ldquo;Excel stuff&rdquo; in R
* <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts">RStudio shortcuts</a>: Keystrokes make everything faster, and this certainly helps
  * Tip for Excel users: If you&rsquo;re using Excel regularly, stop using your mouse!
  * PSS: I love Excel, and R. So if you&rsquo;re crushing Excel regularly and have any R questions, let me know.
* [Introduction to dplyr]: After installing the dplyr package, you can copy/paste sample R code from this site to learn how to use dplyr functions
  * dplyr is one of the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/">Tidyverse packages</a> that makes data manipulation and summarization easier and faster to do in R
* <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>: While R&rsquo;s base graphing capabilities are powerful, the ggplot2 package makes it easier to produce high-quality plots and visualizations (ggplot2 sample below)</p>

<p><strong>Python: The Basics</strong>
<em>Many online Python trainings were made when Python 2.x was standard. Python 3.x is the future of the language, so don&rsquo;t bother installing or learning Python 2.x.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a>: A plethora of Python IDEs exist, PyCharm just happens to be my Python desktop IDE of choice

<ul>
<li>The full version is $89 USD for individual users, but if you&rsquo;re an active student, you can download the entire suite for free.</li>
<li>You can download a free stripped-down community version but it lacks full web development, database and SQL support</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/exercises/basic">Google for Education</a>: Google&rsquo;s Python classes (YouTube links below) are loaded with great content and three downloadable scripts that accompany the lessons - These will take you a few days, and I can&rsquo;t stand that a Python 3.x version has not been released yet, but the quality of the training provided by this instructor is great:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKTZoB2Vjuk">Google&rsquo;s Python Class (Day 1, Part 1)</a>: Introduction and strings</li>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcteAbMC1Ok">Google&rsquo;s Python Class (Day 2, Part 4)</a>: Conclusion</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are two Python reference books that I <em>highly</em> recommend&hellip; I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from these code-as-you-read books and I think the authors did incredible jobs with the introductions to new topics and concepts including NumPy and Pandas

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quick-Python-Book-Naomi-Ceder/dp/1617294039/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1XA1WUL4XS24A&amp;keywords=the+quick+python+book&amp;qid=1553225927&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=the+quick+puthon%2Caps%2C323&amp;sr=8-1">The Quick Python Book by Naomi Ceder (3rd Edition)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1491957662/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=python+for+data+analysis&amp;qid=1553226237&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3">Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney (2nd Edition)</a></li>
