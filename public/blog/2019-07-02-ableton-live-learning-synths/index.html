<p>June was a wild but exciting month&hellip; I finished some major projects for school, graduated, moved, and most recently went abroad on vacation to disconnect. Definitely a nice recharge for the soul! Some neat things are on the horizon and I&rsquo;m excited to release my next wave of Scatter Podcast episodes starting on July 8.</p>
<p>I recently discovered an amazing online learning platform to learn about synthesizers and I had to share it&hellip; This might not be your cup of tea but if you like music, you&rsquo;ll enjoy this. Analog and digital synthesizers have been personal passions of mine over the last 15-20 years. I&rsquo;ve been using Ableton Live for music production and sequencing since the mid-2000s, and the company just released <a href="https://learningsynths.ableton.com/">Learning Synths</a>, an interactive website to teach you synth and sequencing basics. For anyone interested, check it out!</p>
<p>Insider tip: I used Ableton Live to make the intro music for Scatter Podcast.</p>
