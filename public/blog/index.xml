      <description>For my University of California, Irvine, MSBA classmates&amp;hellip; I‚Äôve been blown away by the presentations you‚Äôve given the last few days and humbled by your aptitude for data analytics! Just one more week (of finals! üòÖ)&amp;hellip; we got this!
My team used Python to web-scrape Marvel Cinematic Universe movie rating and financial data since the release of Iron Man (2008). The goal was to predict the US Box Office revenues for Avengers: End Game given ratings, budget, and revenue patterns of all the recent Marvel movies.</description>

      <description>I only started learning Python in January but regularly use Jupyter Notebooks for all of my R-based projects. Last week, I discovered Google Colab&amp;hellip; After spending 24-32 hours on it, I might be in love!
Colab is free, Google cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment for team collaboration. No installs required. Just send your teammates a URL and you&amp;rsquo;re set! Give it a shot with uploading your own Jupyter ipynb files (or see link below).</description>

      <description>Tableau&amp;rsquo;s latest upgrade has a native natural language processing capability called Ask Data - Ask it a question in plain English (&amp;ldquo;What is the profit over time, by business line?&amp;rdquo;) and Tableau &amp;ldquo;determines the most appropriate visualization to satisfy the user‚Äôs intent.&amp;rdquo; Super neat, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to give the upgrade a spin!
On the surface, Ask Data seems gimmicky&amp;hellip; But as a starting point for visualizations, or for near-instant data investigation during a meeting, this is an awesome feature.</description>

      <description>I saw Ben Taylor present a few months back and was blown away. He&amp;rsquo;s continuously researching and educating himself, pushing the limits of deep learning, and he&amp;rsquo;s an advocate of side projects as a vehicle for growth (as am I!). Ben is super passionate about data science, harnessing computational power from GPU/CUDA systems, and his work with generative adversarial networks (GANs) is next level&amp;hellip;

      <description>Super excited with the interviews I&amp;rsquo;ve been recording recently for Scatter Podcast (LAUNCHING SOON)! There are so many great data science podcasts that I regularly enjoy, I&amp;rsquo;m just hoping to offer a slightly different angle. I want to explore and share what &amp;ldquo;data science&amp;rdquo; means at different companies, what day-to-day life is like within those teams, and better understand what experiences and skills certain companies value for potential candidates in their analytics, insights, and data science roles.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago, I knew nothing about the NFL (despite my passion for f√∫tbol!). I teamed up with my classmate and knowledgeable NFL fan, Kaitlyn Drake, and developed a model and game simulation via R to predict the Super Bowl winner and final scores. We predicted the Rams winning 15-14‚Ä¶ it‚Äôll be a close game. We relied on Poisson regression, game simulation, and C4.5 / J48 decision tree to derive our results.</description>

      <description>I joined LinkedIn&amp;rsquo;s Career Advice beta program and have been providing career and interview tips to students and professionals wanting a career change since 2017. Since several students have found my feedback helpful, I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll welcome this unsolicited feedback. Now that I&amp;rsquo;m back in graduate school, it&amp;rsquo;s also a nice reminder for myself as we approach &amp;ldquo;interview season.&amp;rdquo; For some context, I&amp;rsquo;ve never had HR or Recruiter titles, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate to have had many opportunities to interview college students and experienced professionals at EY, PG&amp;amp;E, and KPMG.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in data science, machine learning, and adding business value through data-driven decision making, I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to chat about my experiences so far at the University of California, Irvine. The Paul Merage School of Business did a student profile on me about why I chose the MS in Business Analytics program. UCI placed my profile alongside an overview of the program&amp;rsquo;s curriculum and capstone projects (both of which were key factors for selecting UCI over other universities).</description>

      <description>Network visualizations can be useful for understanding entity and large data interdependencies. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using R and the iGraph package to explore network analysis and found this tutorial to be EXCELLENT by Katherine Ognyanova. It takes a lot of time to build these network graphs and more time to interpret, but definitely rewarding when it provides insights you may have otherwise overlooked. The screenshot above is a network diagram that I made to represent Amazon product copurchases.</description>

      <description>Machine learning via R, Python, (enter your tool of choice here)&amp;hellip; Not bad. But doing machine learning by hand, wow&amp;hellip; This is a true study of patience!
For a school assignment, we had to deconstruct a supervised machine learning model (Naive Bayes) using one data set for training and another for testing, all by hand. This was definitely rewarding being able to understand the depth of conditional probabilities in this classifier model.</description>

Turns out, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; for my system to throttle the CPU at 1.9 GHz. Using ThrottleStop (free), I removed CPU throttling for speed gains and undervolted the CPU/cache/GPU for temperature control. I&amp;rsquo;m running stable at ~3.</description>

      <description>In May 2018, Harvard Business Review published a report (links below) titled &amp;ldquo;Why Marketing Analytics Hasn&amp;rsquo;t Lived Up to Its Promise.&amp;rdquo; My most recent Scatter Podcast guest, Ryan Anderson, wrote a critique of the HBR article that helps frame the conversation in another light: marketing analytics ALONE is not the solution.
We talked about the HBR piece and Ryan&amp;rsquo;s response on this week&amp;rsquo;s podcast release, but being that Ryan has made a career in strategic marketing and web analytics, I&amp;rsquo;d definitely recommend you read both of these articles if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in this line of work!</description>

      <description>Personalized LinkedIn requests CAN be sent through the mobile app&amp;hellip; I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize this until today, but the key is to avoid hitting Connect when you‚Äôre shown a list of recommended contacts (this will send out a boilerplate request message). Instead, navigate to the contact‚Äôs LinkedIn profile and from there, you have access to personalize your request note! Thanks to Kate Strachnyi for her live stream today and her candid advice is always appreciated.</description>

      <description>In mid-March, I worked with a team of UC Irvine students to analyze the Marvel Cinematic Universe and predict US box office revenues for Avengers: Endgame. We estimated US box office revenues to be $639 million and as of today, domestic box office revenues are $645 million!
To my UC Irvine teammates (Ahnni, Daria, Joel, Xiaoting)&amp;hellip; Great job! At the time that we developed our predictions, Captain Marvel had only been in theaters for one week&amp;hellip; I just updated our models and our new domestic box office prediction for Endgame is $670 million.</description>

      <description>Git, GitHub, and distributed version control can make your statistical and data science workflows so much cleaner, more organized, and perfect for collaborative projects. This is a topic that I&amp;rsquo;m just now researching and can&amp;rsquo;t believe that I waited this long to do.
In finance, I was accustomed to saving numerous files per day (adding the date and version to the end of the model filename). Git and GitHub have a learning curve and require effort - I&amp;rsquo;m learning this now and can attest to you needing patience - But, the beauty of this data management process is that instead of saving one file only, you &amp;ldquo;commit&amp;rdquo; or save a multi-file snapshot of your entire project to the cloud!</description>

      <title>dplyr&#39;s if_else vs base R&#39;s ifelse</title>

      <description>When working with data sets of significant size, I&amp;rsquo;m always on the lookout for more efficient code (not necessarily fewer lines of code, but code that processes data faster and more effectively). Recently, I was getting antsy waiting for a simple if/else statement to run via R (I was working with a large GB-sized file on my personal computer). While waiting, I researched alternative approaches for performance improvement and found that dplyr, part of R&amp;rsquo;s Tidyverse and one of my favorite packages for data manipulation, has a vectorized if function perfect for the occasion.</description>
