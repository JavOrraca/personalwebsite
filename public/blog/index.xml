      <title>Docker containers using Binder</title>
      <link>/blog/2019-09-12-docker-container-using-binder/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent weeks slowly (and patiently) learning how to build and deploy Docker containers&amp;hellip; All was good, just dense for beginners. I was elated to find an easier approach to 1) building a Docker image with all the necessary packages / dependencies that you need, and 2) deploying an interactive web notebook (using a RStudio or Jupyter interface).
Some setup is involved, granted, the process is significantly streamlined with Binder. There is one main caveat here - Your data must be on a GitHub repo.</description>

      <description>Anomaly and outlier detection&amp;hellip; Neat, advanced stuff in this space that I finally got my hands dirty with in R. The anomalize package, created by Matt Dancho, helped me identify outliers and smooth out my forecasting model (backtesting also improved). I used anomalize in conjunction with Facebook&amp;rsquo;s prophet for a time-series projection. For R users out there: This package works beautifully with the tidyverse.
I&amp;rsquo;m continuously impressed by the stuff that Matt puts out including educational content, tutorials, webinars, and his package development.</description>

      <description>Design thinking is being talked about a lot more these days. It is an iterative, problem-solving approach that helps new solutions come to light that aren&amp;rsquo;t always apparent at first glance. Design thinking is not a new concept, designers have used it for years, and it can be used in all aspects of business to conceptualize alternative strategies or to justify your original solution.
Most recently, design thinking has been championed by leading data scientists (and non-technical professionals) given the benefits of applying a scientific method to solving business problems.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been really quiet recently&amp;hellip; All is great, just busy with some client projects and building two websites for myself for the first time (both using R and this site included!). I wanted to share this awesome catalog of Tableau Software charts presented by Kevin Flerlage. Amazing stuff here and great reference to bookmark. Sometimes, all we need is a little creative inspiration to help us design stunning charts. Happy visualizing!</description>

      <description>Python users: pip install plotly==4.0.0
Definitely excited to use the updated Plotly.py. This shift to offline-only is amazing. It &amp;ldquo;requires no internet connection, no account, no authentication tokens, and no payment of any kind.&amp;rdquo; Great stuff here, and now Plotly Express comes built in to make interactive plot making even easier&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;plotly.express is to plotly what seaborn is to matplotlib&amp;rdquo;
For you Jupyter and Colab fans, rendering Plotly figures to these notebooks (and other IDEs) should now feel a lot less clunky.</description>

      <description>Here are a few tips, learned the hard way, for Linux beginners, data science students, or practitioners wanting to use Linux for machine learning and AI:
1) If you plan on dual-booting with Windows, there is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Setting up your Windows and BIOS settings to allow for disk partitions and Linux dual-boot can be manufacturer and/or Windows-version specific. I have a Lenovo ThinkPad and I am running pre-installed Windows 10 Professional&amp;hellip; If you have a similar system and looking to dual-boot, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to help with Ubuntu.</description>

      <description>Many of the developers and data scientists that I follow on LinkedIn have had extensive exposure to Docker for building and deploying apps via containers&amp;hellip; I have not, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this for months and finally got around to researching where to start. I came across this IN-DEPTH(!!) and well-written Docker Tutorial for Beginners by Prakhar Srivastav.
Amazing stuff here, and exactly the kind of resource that I like to share.</description>

      <description>I came across this meme today and it cracked me up&amp;hellip; There&amp;rsquo;s a big difference between lying on your resume and embellishing (I&amp;rsquo;ve written about this before, but even with embellishing, there is a line that you can easily cross). But folks&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t lie about your experience on your resume. It&amp;rsquo;s not good for you or your employer (if they fall for your lies), and definitely not good for your reputation if you get into something way over your head.</description>

      <guid>/blog/2019-07-13-exporting-plots-from-r-to-powerpoint/</guid>
      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a super useful and easy approach, with sample code, for exporting R ggplot2 plots to PowerPoint as geometric shapes (vector objects). Using the officer R package, you&amp;rsquo;re able to edit the styling of your plots directly in PowerPoint to match your presentation theme or change to your liking. This also works on LibreOffice for Linux distributions.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve previously posted about the benefits of the dplyr package for data manipulation and performing if/else functions, but I wanted to share this R-bloggers post by Markus Berroth. The post includes base R vs dplyr sample code to demonstrate how dplyr can make life easier for data scientists. The Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) illustrations are also super helpful for understanding what&amp;rsquo;s happening with your R code.
These type of AST visuals are all over Hadley Wickham&amp;rsquo;s Advanced R (Second Edition), and they&amp;rsquo;ve definitely helped me to better understand my R code.</description>

      <description>This is a great, 22-minute presentation by Neil Sahota at an AI conference. I met Sahota through UC Irvine, he recently taught my Technology &amp;amp; Analytics Consulting graduate course. In this video, Sahota discusses how AI can be used for social good and biodiversity. Professor Sahota is a beast&amp;hellip; In addition to recently publishing his first book on AI for business, he&amp;rsquo;s extremely active in the data science community and contributes through mentorship and consulting, he&amp;rsquo;s an IBM Master Inventor, he&amp;rsquo;s the United Nations AI subject matter expert, and co-founder of the AI for Good initiative.</description>

      <description>Rahul Agarwal recently wrote an article for Towards Data Science that provides a great overview on the history of MapReduce, Spark, and using Python / PySpark for data engineering. I worked on a project recently with two people and we were shocked at how computationally efficient Spark was for our use case. We were able to load, read, manipulate, and explore over 30 GB of data in a Google Colab, GPU-enabled environment without reaching Google&amp;rsquo;s RAM limitation&amp;hellip; If you&amp;rsquo;ve used Colab, you know that you can eat through 12 GB of GPU RAM quickly.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m done with school but excited to continue learning! I picked up a copy of Jonathan Regenstein&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Reproducible Finance with R&amp;rdquo; and Hadley Wickham&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Advanced R&amp;rdquo; (2nd Edition, recently released). For my old co-workers in valuation, financial modeling, and corporate finance, I urge all of you to learn the R programming language. I assure you that you&amp;rsquo;ll still use Excel (often), but from a reproducibility perspective for your complex recurring analyses and forecasts, R is a better solution for you.</description>

Definitely a nice recharge for the soul! Some neat things are on the horizon and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to release my next wave of Scatter Podcast episodes starting on July 8.
I recently discovered an amazing online learning platform to learn about synthesizers and I had to share it&amp;hellip; This might not be your cup of tea but if you like music, you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy this.</description>

      <description>Several months back, I launched Scatter Podcast to share insights about all things &amp;ldquo;data science&amp;rdquo; and career tips from leaders in the space. On my podcast, I interview practitioners to demystify what it means to be a data scientist since it has many shapes and forms in business intelligence, advanced analytics, programming, and data storytelling.
The UCI Paul Merage School of Business recently interviewed me and published an article about my work with Scatter Podcast (link below).</description>

      <description>Where will Salesforce stock (CRM) be at the end of 2019? $178.40! I used R to produce a multi-variate time series model and Tableau to visualize historical CRM stock prices (grey line) vs my model (blue line), including my Dec 2019 prediction (red dot). The model was built in February using historical stock price data from 2004 to 2018. Play around with the Tableau viz (link below)!

      <description>Super excited about voila! Creating interactive web dashboards with Jupyter Notebooks via R or Python is getting easier, faster, and hopefully with more control.
Plotly API calls have been manageable for me through Jupyter Notebooks, but I&amp;rsquo;ve certainly seem some limitations using the free Plotly account, Plotly Offline, or similar offline packages.
Either way, Project Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s developments with JupyterLab, JupyterHub, and QuantStack&amp;rsquo;s voila are about to make programming collaboration and visualizations a lot more fun!</description>

I have a knack for time-series analyses given most of the financial data and modeling I previously worked with was time-series based.

      <description>Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) can be phenomenal for processing deep learning models in the cloud, but there&amp;rsquo;s a catch - especially if you&amp;rsquo;re a student or enthusiast with no corporate account access - These cloud tools get expensive! For $1-3 per hour, you can cloud compute using AWS or GCP&amp;hellip; Not bad! But if you want extended access to your cloud instances, or 24&amp;frasl;7 access as I&amp;rsquo;d like to have, cloud solutions become cost prohibitive.</description>

I found the microbenchmark package and started exploring faster file read methods relative to base R. I discovered Tidyverse&amp;rsquo;s readr and vroom packages, and while I had used the data.</description>

      <description>In May 2018, Harvard Business Review published a report (links below) titled &amp;ldquo;Why Marketing Analytics Hasn&amp;rsquo;t Lived Up to Its Promise.&amp;rdquo; My most recent Scatter Podcast guest, Ryan Anderson, wrote a critique of the HBR article that helps frame the conversation in another light: marketing analytics ALONE is not the solution.
We talked about the HBR piece and Ryan&amp;rsquo;s response on this week&amp;rsquo;s podcast release, but being that Ryan has made a career in strategic marketing and web analytics, I&amp;rsquo;d definitely recommend you read both of these articles if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in this line of work!</description>

      <description>In mid-March, I worked with a team of UC Irvine students to analyze the Marvel Cinematic Universe and predict US box office revenues for Avengers: Endgame. We estimated US box office revenues to be $639 million and as of today, domestic box office revenues are $645 million!
To my UC Irvine teammates (Ahnni, Daria, Joel, Xiaoting)&amp;hellip; Great job! At the time that we developed our predictions, Captain Marvel had only been in theaters for one week&amp;hellip; I just updated our models and our new domestic box office prediction for Endgame is $670 million.</description>

      <description>Git, GitHub, and distributed version control can make your statistical and data science workflows so much cleaner, more organized, and perfect for collaborative projects. This is a topic that I&amp;rsquo;m just now researching and can&amp;rsquo;t believe that I waited this long to do.
In finance, I was accustomed to saving numerous files per day (adding the date and version to the end of the model filename). Git and GitHub have a learning curve and require effort - I&amp;rsquo;m learning this now and can attest to you needing patience - But, the beauty of this data management process is that instead of saving one file only, you &amp;ldquo;commit&amp;rdquo; or save a multi-file snapshot of your entire project to the cloud!</description>

Forbes interviewed her for a piece on How to Get Your Data Scientist Career Started and she was kind enough to mention Scatter Podcast as a resource for students to keep current on analytics and data science concepts. Great article and especially beneficial for early career data science job seekers.

      <description>Personalized LinkedIn requests CAN be sent through the mobile app&amp;hellip; I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize this until today, but the key is to avoid hitting Connect when you’re shown a list of recommended contacts (this will send out a boilerplate request message). Instead, navigate to the contact’s LinkedIn profile and from there, you have access to personalize your request note! Thanks to Kate Strachnyi for her live stream today and her candid advice is always appreciated.</description>

      <description>When working with data sets of significant size, I&amp;rsquo;m always on the lookout for more efficient code (not necessarily fewer lines of code, but code that processes data faster and more effectively). Recently, I was getting antsy waiting for a simple if/else statement to run via R (I was working with a large GB-sized file on my personal computer). While waiting, I researched alternative approaches for performance improvement and found that dplyr, part of R&amp;rsquo;s Tidyverse and one of my favorite packages for data manipulation, has a vectorized if function perfect for the occasion.</description>

Turns out, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; for my system to throttle the CPU at 1.9 GHz. Using ThrottleStop (free), I removed CPU throttling for speed gains and undervolted the CPU/cache/GPU for temperature control. I&amp;rsquo;m running stable at ~3.</description>

On the surface, Ask Data seems gimmicky&amp;hellip; But as a starting point for visualizations, or for near-instant data investigation during a meeting, this is an awesome feature.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago, I knew nothing about the NFL (despite my passion for fútbol!). I teamed up with my classmate and knowledgeable NFL fan, Kaitlyn Drake, and developed a model and game simulation via R to predict the Super Bowl winner and final scores. We predicted the Rams winning 15-14… it’ll be a close game. We relied on Poisson regression, game simulation, and C4.5 / J48 decision tree to derive our results.</description>

For a school assignment, we had to deconstruct a supervised machine learning model (Naive Bayes) using one data set for training and another for testing, all by hand. This was definitely rewarding being able to understand the depth of conditional probabilities in this classifier model.</description>
