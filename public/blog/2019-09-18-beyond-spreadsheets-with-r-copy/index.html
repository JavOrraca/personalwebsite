<p>I love good reference books and one that I keep on my bookshelf is <em>Beyond Spreadsheets with R</em>, by Dr. Jonathan Carroll. I&rsquo;ve read through a lot of beginner&rsquo;s guides to R and RStudio - If you come from a traditional financial modeling background, or you&rsquo;re a daily power user of Microsoft Excel, I highly recommend this book. It teaches you everything from data manipulation to summarizing and grouping data, to looping with the R <code>purrr</code> package.</p>

<p>In my opinion, Dr. Carroll lays out one of the easiest-to-follow and best introductions to vectorization and the benefits of the <code>purrr</code> package. As stated by Dr. Carroll in Chapter 8 (link below), with <code>purrr</code>, &ldquo;you can think of just about everything as a series of functions to apply repeatedly to elements.&rdquo; In corporate finance and financial modeling terms, the <code>purrr</code> package is essentially your answer to super long, complicated, nested IF statements in Excel.</p>
