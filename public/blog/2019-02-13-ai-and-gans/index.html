<p>I saw <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentaylordata/">Ben Taylor</a> present a few months back and was blown away. He&rsquo;s continuously researching and educating himself, pushing the limits of deep learning, and he&rsquo;s an advocate of side projects as a vehicle for growth (as am I!). Ben is super passionate about data science, harnessing computational power from GPU/CUDA systems, and his work with generative adversarial networks (GANs) is next level&hellip;</p>

<p>The image above is an AI-produced synthetic face made possible through GANs. Ben believes that continued innovation in GANs could allow us to predict DNA from a face, or vice versa, generating a face from DNA. I highly recommend you follow this reasonable futurist regardless of your discipline on LinkedIn or YouTube!</p>
