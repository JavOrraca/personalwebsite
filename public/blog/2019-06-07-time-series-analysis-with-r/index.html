<p>I just got <em>Hands-On Time Series Analysis with R</em>, by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rami-krispin/">Rami Krispin</a>, and can&rsquo;t wait to crack it open! I have a knack for time-series analyses given most of the financial data and modeling I previously worked with was time-series based. Had I known the full potential of advanced time-series forecasting techniques, I would have implemented some of these techniques <em>yesterday</em>! But as the saying goes, <em>and it&rsquo;s so cliche, but true</em>, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amazon has gotten crazy with their shipping&hellip; under no circumstances did I need this hard copy delivered in less than 24 hours, but glad to have it nonetheless! Congrats on your book, Rami! Excited to give your packages and methods a try.</p>
