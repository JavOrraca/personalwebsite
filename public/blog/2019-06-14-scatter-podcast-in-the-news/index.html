<p>Several months back, I launched Scatter Podcast to share insights about all things &ldquo;data science&rdquo; and career tips from leaders in the space. On my podcast, I interview practitioners to demystify what it means to be a data scientist since it has many shapes and forms in business intelligence, advanced analytics, programming, and data storytelling.</p>

<p>The UCI Paul Merage School of Business recently interviewed me and published an article about my work with Scatter Podcast (link below). To UCI Merage, all of my talented professors, mentors, and especially my listeners, thank you for the love! I&rsquo;ve reconnected with and met incredibly talented people, and I&rsquo;m excited to see where this project goes.</p>
