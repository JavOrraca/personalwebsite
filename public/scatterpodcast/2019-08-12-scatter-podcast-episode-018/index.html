<p>Lots of neat things happening at the intersection of media &amp; entertainment, analytics, and operations. For <a href="https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast/episode-018"><em>Episode 018</em> of Scatter Podcast</a>, I interviewed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leondrajames/">Leondra R. James</a>, Manager, Analytics &amp; Operations at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.</p>

<p>From violinist and music major to data scientist, Leondra has had a unique mix of academic and professional experiences that shaped her career in data. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi is a global advertising agency operating in 76 countries and Leondra works in their Los Angeles office. She joined the agency in January 2019 but she&rsquo;s no stranger to media &amp; entertainment having previously held data analytics roles at Alternative Revolt Magazine, Amazon Studios, and Twentieth Century Fox.</p>

<p>For creatives and non-technical people wanting to explore careers in data science, Leondra offers words of encouragement and provides feedback not often discussed in the data science community: &ldquo;Your creativity is a strength that would benefit any data team!&rdquo; Leondra drops lots of great tips and resources, so get ready to take some notes!</p>

<p><strong>Post-interview notes from Leondra:</strong>
For you R users out there&hellip; Leondra shares some awesome packages to check out for business process analytics including bupaR and processmapR. Check out the links below. For general R and data science learning, I recommend the following resources which offer free-to-audit / affordable resources for learning: Coursera, Edx, SoloLearn, Code Academy, Khan Academy, Udacity, Kaggle, Future Learn, Lynda.com, DataCamp, Super Data Science, (and for cloud computing courses&hellip;) Google Cloud, AWS. The course I recommend for beginners looking to get a review on common algorithms and learning R / Python is Jose Portilla&rsquo;s Data Science &amp; Machine Learning Bootcamps on Udemy. He has one in Python and another in R. I would also recommend that people attend Meetups.</p>
