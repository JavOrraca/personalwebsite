This isn&rsquo;t a traditional data science episode but one focused on a topic that analytics and data science teams should become familiar with: Design Thinking. Design thinking is not a new concept, product designers like Ben have used it for decades, yet it is a framework that can be used in almost all aspects of business to justify your existing solution or to develop alternative solutions."/>

<p>On <a href="https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast/episode-020"><em>Episode 020</em> of Scatter Podcast</a>, I had a lot of fun hosting industrial designer Ben Denzinger, Product Designer at MaCher. This isn&rsquo;t a traditional data science episode but one focused on a topic that analytics and data science teams should become familiar with: Design Thinking. Design thinking is not a new concept, product designers like Ben have used it for decades, yet it is a framework that can be used in almost all aspects of business to justify your existing solution or to develop alternative solutions.</p>
<p>Ben&rsquo;s design journey is great to hear and he walks us through his education and career experiences as an Industrial Designer and Product Manager. As Product Designer at MaCher, it is fascinating to hear how the business empowers their employees to self-manage, to use the design thinking process, and to continuously re-think what it means to make sustainable products. Enjoy the episode!</p>
