title: And voila! Interactive Dashboards for Jupyter
---

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JavOrraca/Home/gh-pages/assets/img/voila.png)

Super excited about voila! Creating interactive web dashboards with Jupyter Notebooks via R or Python is getting easier, faster, and hopefully with more control.

Plotly API calls have been manageable for me through Jupyter Notebooks, but I've certainly seem some limitations using the free Plotly account, Plotly Offline, or similar offline packages.

Either way, Project Jupyter's developments with JupyterLab, JupyterHub, and QuantStack's voila are about to make programming collaboration and visualizations a lot more fun! Pro tip: If you regularly use Jupyter Notebooks, make the switch to JupyterLab (or give it a try).
