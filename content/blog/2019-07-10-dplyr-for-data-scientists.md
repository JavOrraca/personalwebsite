title: R + dplyr for Data Scientists
---

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JavOrraca/Home/gh-pages/assets/img/dplyr.jpg)

I've [previously posted](https://javorraca.github.io/Home/dplyr-for-R.html) about the benefits of the dplyr package for data manipulation and performing if/else functions, but I wanted to share this R-bloggers post by Markus Berroth. The post includes base R vs dplyr sample code to demonstrate how dplyr can make life easier for data scientists. The Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) illustrations are also super helpful for understanding what's happening with your R code.

These type of AST visuals are all over Hadley Wickham's _Advanced R (Second Edition)_, and they've definitely helped me to better understand my R code. My copy of Wickham's _Advanced R_ has already seen plenty of my handwritten notes... I love a good physical book to reference on my bookshelf... but rest assured, it's also available for free, in full, online!
