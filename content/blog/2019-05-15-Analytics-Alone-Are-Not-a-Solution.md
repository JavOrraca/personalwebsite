In May 2018, Harvard Business Review published a report (links below) titled "Why Marketing Analytics Hasn't Lived Up to Its Promise." [My most recent Scatter Podcast guest, Ryan Anderson](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast/episode-010), wrote a critique of the HBR article that helps frame the conversation in another light: marketing analytics ALONE is not the solution.

We talked about the HBR piece and Ryan's response on this week's podcast release, but being that Ryan has made a career in strategic marketing and web analytics, I'd definitely recommend you read both of these articles if you're interested in this line of work!
