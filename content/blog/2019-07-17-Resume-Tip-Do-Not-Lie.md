title: Resume Tip... Don't Lie!
---

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JavOrraca/Home/gh-pages/assets/img/PoliceDog.jfif)

I came across this meme today and it cracked me up... There's a big difference between lying on your resume and embellishing (I've written about this before, but even with embellishing, there is a line that you can _easily_ cross). But folks... don't lie about your experience on your resume. It's not good for you or your employer (if they fall for your lies), and definitely not good for your reputation if you get into something way over your head. I hope your week is productive and going well!
