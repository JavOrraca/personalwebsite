title: Robots and Modern Art Installations

If you’re based in SoCal, I highly recommend a visit to the Telestron installation (Feb 23 - March 28). This is an immersive, futuristic light show put on by VTProDesign and GMUNK. I love the intersection of art+technology and these robots do not disappoint!
