A few weeks ago, I had Will Chase [on my podcast](https://www.javierorraca.com/scatterpodcast/episode-022/) to talk about his work as a researcher and data visualization professional. Super exciting news for Will... His visualizing earthquake risk project was shortlisted for the Information is Beautiful 2019 Awards (the Science & Technology category). Give it a look and if you like what you see, please vote for his amazing project!! Congrats Will!
