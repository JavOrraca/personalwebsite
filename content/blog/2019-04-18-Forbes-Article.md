I had the privilege of recently interviewing data rockstar [Alyssa Columbus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acolum/), Data Scientist at Pacific Life and NASA Datanaut. Forbes interviewed her for a piece on [_How to Get Your Data Scientist Career Started_](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2019/04/14/how-to-get-your-data-scientist-career-started/) and she was kind enough to mention Scatter Podcast as a resource for students to keep current on analytics and data science concepts. Great article and especially beneficial for early career data science job seekers.
