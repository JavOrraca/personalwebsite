title: Building a Deep Learning GPU Server
---

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JavOrraca/Home/gh-pages/assets/img/GPU_comparison.png)

Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) can be phenomenal for processing deep learning models in the cloud, but there's a catch - _especially if you're a student or enthusiast with no corporate account access_ - These cloud tools get expensive! For $1-3 per hour, you can cloud compute using AWS or GCP... Not bad! But if you want extended access to your cloud instances, or 24/7 access as I'd like to have, cloud solutions become cost prohibitive.

Alas, my recent obsession for a fun home project... Building my own deep learning GPU server that I'd keep at home and access remotely, as needed. I've never built a computer so this project has me excited, a little scared, and eager to run my personal models faster... This would help so much in the data science process of evaluating models and iterating / improving more quickly.

If you have words of caution or advice, or maybe something major that I'm missing, please shoot me an email or contact me via LinkedIn or GitHub!
