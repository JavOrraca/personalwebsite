It pains me to share a Medium article of _any kind_ these days because the bane of my existence is reaching my Medium article limit on the first day of the month (#EndRant). The BBC News data science and visualization team published this great overview on their lessons learned after using R for visualizations over the course of 1.5 years.

Great read, AND super neat to see the BBC team open-source their BBPLOT and R Cookbook to help streamline your visualization workflows, reduce manual repetition of code setup for a ggplot2 viz, and to educate you on better storytelling approaches with R.
