On [Episode 009 of Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast/episode-009), I'm really excited to release my interview with [Perrin Quarshie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/perrinq/), CEO & Founder of RealBlocks. For those of you interested in real estate, technology, investing, blockchain... This episode is for you!

Built upon the Ethereum blockchain, RealBlocks allows accredited investors to buy into private equity real estate funds through the purchase of digital assets. RealBlocks went through #Techstars NYC's program (one of the top startup accelerators) and recently raised $3.1 million in seed funding in January 2019. Awesome stuff happening in NYC!
