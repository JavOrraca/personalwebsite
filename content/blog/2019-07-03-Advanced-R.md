I'm done with school but excited to continue learning! I picked up a copy of [Jonathan Regenstein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jkregenstein/)'s "Reproducible Finance with R" and [Hadley Wickham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hadleywickham/)'s "Advanced R" (2nd Edition, recently released). For my old co-workers in valuation, financial modeling, and corporate finance, I urge all of you to learn the R programming language. I assure you that you'll still use Excel (_often_), but from a reproducibility perspective for your complex recurring analyses and forecasts, R is a better solution for you. I'd be happy to provide some pointers, shoot me an email or reach me via LinkedIn.
