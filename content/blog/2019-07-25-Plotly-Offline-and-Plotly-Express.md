title: Plotly.py 4.0 - Offline Visualizations
---

Python users: `pip install plotly==4.0.0`

Definitely excited to use the updated Plotly.py. This shift to offline-only is amazing. It "requires no internet connection, no account, no authentication tokens, and no payment of any kind." Great stuff here, and now Plotly Express comes built in to make interactive plot making even easier... "plotly.express is to plotly what seaborn is to matplotlib"

For you Jupyter and Colab fans, rendering Plotly figures to these notebooks (and other IDEs) should now feel a lot less clunky. Happy plotting!
