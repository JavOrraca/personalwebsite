title: Linux & Ubuntu Help Request
---

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JavOrraca/Home/gh-pages/assets/img/Ubuntu.jpg)

I have been thinking of giving Ubuntu a shot... I'm currently using Windows 10 (and all is good, honestly). Granted, the more I dive into analytics and data science research (and especially GPU processing), the more benefit I see from driving my data management and machine learning through a Linux command prompt.

Backstory: I've been researching external GPU rigs and I am considering building one. I wouldn't use it for gaming but for faster ML (i.e., Nvidia GPU CUDA processing)... That's where this Linux (and Ubuntu distro) interest stemmed from. If you have strong opinions, would love to hear from you!

Linux distros that I'm considering:
<br/>[Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)
<br/>[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)
<br/>[Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.debian.org/)
