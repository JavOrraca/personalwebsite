title: 15 Tips on Making Better Use of R
---

![RStudio Webinar](/RStudio-Webinar.jpeg)

If you use R but aren't using R Markdown, you should be. It's such a great way to make reports come to life. I've been using it more in the last month than I have in the last year and can't believe how much more interactive I've made my deliverables (and even my own data exploration). Really excited to see what new tricks I can learn from RStudio's webinar on Friday, November 15!
