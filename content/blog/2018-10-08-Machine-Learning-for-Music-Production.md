title: Machine Learning for Music Production
---

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JavOrraca/Home/gh-pages/assets/img/Factorsynth.jpg)

If you know me personally, you likely know I enjoy playing with analog / digital synthesizers and experimental music production. I love seeing my interests cross... FactorSynth, a new virtual musical tool and Ableton Live plug-in, uses machine learning to decompose your audio clips into elements. These musical elements can then be modified and recombined in various ways (in real-time). Check out this demo reel (my words don't do this new device justice)!
