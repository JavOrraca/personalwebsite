![R Shiny](/Shiny.jpeg)

Every once in a blue moon when I log into Twitter, I'll come across some gems that excite me... Such was the case this morning when I learned that [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) of RStudio is writing a book called "Mastering Shiny," expected for publication in late 2020 by O'Reilly Media.

If you're interested in a free resource for learning how to develop R Shiny web apps, the first few chapters of "Mastering Shiny" are online (in development) full of code samples to follow. Enjoy the read and if you find anything confusing or not clear, feel free to reach out to Hadley Wickham with your feedback (per his request on Twitter!).
