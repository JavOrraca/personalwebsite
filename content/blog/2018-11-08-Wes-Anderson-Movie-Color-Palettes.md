title: Wes Anderson Color Palettes for R
---

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JavOrraca/Home/gh-pages/assets/img/GrandBudapestMatrix.jpg)

Are you a Wes Anderson fan and regular R user? If you want a color scheme makeover for your R visualizations, check out this fun Wes Anderson color palette package by [Karthik Ram](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karthik-ram-93334954/). Great stuff... I just tried out The Grand Budapest Hotel palette for a correlation matrix (see above)!

Props to my classmate [Kaitlyn Drake](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaitdrake/) for finding this gem!
