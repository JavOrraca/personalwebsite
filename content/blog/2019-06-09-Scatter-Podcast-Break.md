title: Scatter Podcast Break & UCI's MSBA Class
---

Scatter Podcast will be on a short hiatus this week and next, but returning in two weeks with fresh new content from data scientists in consulting, transportation planning, banking, automobile manufacturing, and more! School got in the way wrapping up massive projects, reports, and final exams.

The last year has flown by and I'm graduating with a MS in Business Analytics from University of California, Irvine. This is a snapshot of my MSBA class... Smart, kind, and funny people from all over the world and now I get to call them friends. Congrats folks!
