title: LinkedIn Personalized Requests on Mobile App
---

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JavOrraca/Home/gh-pages/assets/img/LinkedIn_Logo.png)

Personalized LinkedIn requests _CAN_ be sent through the mobile app... I didn't realize this until today, but the key is to avoid hitting Connect when you’re shown a list of recommended contacts (this will send out a boilerplate request message). Instead, navigate to the contact’s LinkedIn profile and from there, you have access to personalize your request note! Thanks to [Kate Strachnyi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kate-strachnyi-data/) for her live stream today and her candid advice is always appreciated.
