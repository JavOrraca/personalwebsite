title: UC Irvine's MS in Business Analytics
---

If you're interested in data science, machine learning, and adding business value through data-driven decision making, I'd be happy to chat about my experiences so far at the University of California, Irvine. The Paul Merage School of Business did a student profile on me about why I chose the MS in Business Analytics program. UCI placed my profile alongside an overview of the program's curriculum and capstone projects (both of which were key factors for selecting UCI over other universities).

Every week has been exciting and challenging, but I have learned _so much_ in just two quarters including statistics, data science concepts, programming, marketing analytics, visualizations, linear and non-linear programming for simulation and optimization modeling, etc. You'll learn to really learn again and it feels so great to grow in this way. Check out the student profile in the below and if you're interested in a program like UCI's MSBA, feel free to contact me with any questions. I'll give you my objective perspective of the good and the bad (but mostly good!).
