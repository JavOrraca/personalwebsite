title: Tips From a Data Science Consultant
---

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JavOrraca/Home/gh-pages/assets/img/Tim.jpg)

The data science community is super welcoming... It's been great connecting with professionals all over the world, meeting other beginners and helping each other out, sharing best practices and educational resources. I was excited to recently hear an interview with [Tim Lafferty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-lafferty/) (Georgia Tech alum!) on the Super Data Science Podcast discussing life as a data science consultant. Really practical tips here (even bought Kirill's book, [_Confident Data Skills_](https://confidentdataskills.com/) after the listen!).
