title: Editable ggplot2 plots from R to PowerPoint
---

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JavOrraca/Home/gh-pages/assets/img/editable_plots.png)

Here's a super useful and easy approach, with sample code, for exporting R ggplot2 plots to PowerPoint as geometric shapes (vector objects). Using the officer R package, you're able to edit the styling of your plots directly in PowerPoint to match your presentation theme or change to your liking. This also works on LibreOffice for Linux distributions.
