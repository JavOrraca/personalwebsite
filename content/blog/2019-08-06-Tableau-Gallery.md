I've been really quiet recently... All is great, just busy with some client projects and building two websites for myself for the first time (both using `R` and this site included!). I wanted to share this awesome catalog of Tableau Software charts presented by Kevin Flerlage. Amazing stuff here and great reference to bookmark. Sometimes, all we need is a little creative inspiration to help us design stunning charts. Happy visualizing!
