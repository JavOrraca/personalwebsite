First quarter of grad school is finally over! Now with some free time, I finally learned Git (for BASH emulation), set up a GitHub account, and looking forward to collaborating on analytics projects. If you're interested in R or machine learning, one of my projects is a basic ML exercise that relies on the k-means algorithm for clustering.
