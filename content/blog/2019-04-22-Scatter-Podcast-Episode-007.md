On [Episode 007 of Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast/episode-007), I interview guest [Nicholas Stavrou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-stavrou/) and discuss his work as an Associate Scientist in Computational Biology at [NeoGenomics Laboratories](https://neogenomics.com/), a cancer diagnostic and pharma research company. Neo is advancing precision medication and Nicholas and I had an engaging talk about cancer cell classification, neural networks and AI models for cancer research, and how Nicholas developed his skills to land his role at Neo. Nicholas graduated from USC in 2017 and he shares some great tips and resources. Enjoy the show!
