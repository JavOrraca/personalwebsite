![Javier Orraca](/Javier.jpg)

My name is Javier Orraca and I drive business value for corporations and privately held businesses through data, predictive modeling, and empowering stakeholders with robust decision analytics.

## Background

My career includes over a decade of data analysis, consulting, financial modeling, and data science for Ernst & Young (EY), Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), KPMG, and Centene Corporation (Health Net of California). I had a vision of providing more value to business organizations so I began to explore and learn how to apply statistics, advanced analytics, and machine learning for data-driven decision making.

Finding a new passion in analytics and data science, I pursued a Business Analytics graduate degree at the University of California, Irvine, and graduated in 2019. Throughout my graduate program, I leveraged my data and financial modeling experiences to help financial services firms, advertising agencies, and retail businesses. Throughout my masters program, I developed a commercial AI product for financial modelers and since graduating, I have been at Health Net as a Data Scientist III. My core responsibilities include the development of machine learning and AI models for strategic insights.

## Scatter Podcast

Iâ€™m humbled to be part of the data science community, continuously learning, networking, and sharing best practices around programming, advanced statistical analyses, data visualizations, machine learning, and data analytics. I launched [Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast) to share career tips and insights from data science leaders that I interview.

## Web Development

I am not a web developer but I created this website using the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language, [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). My site renders in less than 80ms and I'm hosting it for free... It only cost me time and $15/year for the domain name. Open-source tools are fast, flexible, fun, and paving the future of analytics.
