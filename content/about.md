title: About
---

My name is Javier Orraca and I drive business value for corporations and privately held businesses through data analytics, predictive modeling, and empowering stakeholders with robust decision analytics.

## Background

My career includes over a decade of consulting, data analysis, and fixed asset valuation modeling for Ernst & Young (EY), Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), and KPMG. My work supported M&A financial reporting requirements and strategic finance initiatives. I had a vision of providing _more_ value to business organizations than what my M&A and valuation work allowed for, so I began to explore and learn how to apply regressions and machine learning for advanced, data-driven decision making.

Finding a new passion in analytics and data science, I pursued a Business Analytics graduate degree at the University of California, Irvine, and graduated in 2019. Throughout my graduate program, I leveraged my data and financial modeling experiences to help financial services firms, creative advertising agencies, and several retail businesses. I developed a commercial AI product for financial modelers, and am currently available for analytics consulting opportunities. If you are interested in partnering on a commercial product or want to learn more about my analytics service offerings, please contact me for a free consultation.

## Scatter Podcast

I’m humbled to be part of the data science community, continuously learning, networking, and sharing best practices around programming, advanced statistical analyses, data visualizations, machine learning, and data analytics. I launched [Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast) to share career tips and insights from data science leaders that I interview.

## Web Development

I am not a web developer but I created this website using the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language, [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). My site renders in less than 100ms and I'm hosting it for _free_... It only cost me time and $15/year for the domain name. Open-source tools are fast, flexible, fun, and paving the future of analytics.
