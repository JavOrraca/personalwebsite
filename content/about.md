My name is Javier Orraca and I drive business value for corporations and privately held businesses through data, predictive modeling, and empowering stakeholders with robust decision analytics.

## Background

My career includes over a decade of consulting, data analysis, and fixed asset valuation modeling for Ernst & Young (EY), Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), and KPMG. My work supported M&A financial reporting requirements and strategic finance initiatives. I had a vision of providing more value to business organizations than what my M&A and valuation work allowed for, so I began to explore and learn how to apply regressions and machine learning for advanced, data-driven decision making.

Finding a new passion in analytics and data science, I pursued a Business Analytics graduate degree at the University of California, Irvine, and graduated in 2019. Throughout my graduate program, I leveraged my data and financial modeling experiences to help financial services firms, advertising agencies, and retail businesses. I developed a commercial AI product for financial modelers, and am currently available for consulting opportunities. If you are interested in partnering on a commercial product or want to learn more about my analytics service offerings, please contact me.

## Scatter Podcast

## Web Development

I am not a web developer but I created this website using the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language, [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). My site renders in less than 80ms and I'm hosting it for free... It only cost me time and $15/year for the domain name. Open-source tools are fast, flexible, fun, and paving the future of analytics.
