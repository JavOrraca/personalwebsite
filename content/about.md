title: About
---

My name is Javier Orraca and I drive business value for corporations and privately held businesses through data analytics, predictive modeling, and empowering stakeholders with robust decision analytics.

## Background

My career includes over a decade of consulting, data analysis, and fixed asset valuation modeling for Ernst & Young (EY), Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), and KPMG. My work supported M&A financial reporting requirements and strategic finance initiatives. I had a vision of providing _more_ value to business organizations than what my M&A and valuation work allowed for, so I began to explore and learn how to apply regressions and machine learning for advanced, data-driven decision making.

Finding a new passion in analytics and data science, I pursued a Business Analytics graduate degree at the University of California, Irvine, and graduated in 2019. Throughout my graduate program, I leveraged my consulting and data modeling experience to find analytics consulting opportunities for global financial services firms, advertising agencies, and several retail businesses. I have developed a commercial AI product for financial modelers, and am currently open for business for consulting opportunities. If you are interested in partnering on a commercial product or want to learn more about my analytics service offerings, please contact me for a consultation.

## Scatter Podcast

Iâ€™m humbled to be part of the data science community, continuously learning, networking, and sharing best practices around programming, advanced statistical analyses, data visualizations, machine learning, and data analytics. I launched [Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast) to share career tips and insights from data science leaders that I interview.

## Web Development

I created this website using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). My site renders in less than 90ms. I'm hosting it all for free... _FREE!_ It only cost me time and $15/year for the domain name. Open-source tools are fast, flexible, fun, and the way of the future.
