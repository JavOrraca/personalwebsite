On [Episode 013 of Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast/episode-013), I had a great time interviewing [Beau Walker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beauthescientist/), Founder & CEO of Method Data Science. Beau is actively involved in the data science community, is a passionate R and Python educator, and it was a pleasure to glean some career insights from him. Method is on a mission to inspire and train the next generation of data scientists, and they're accomplishing this by managing small teams of Resident Data Scientists working on real-world data engagements. Beau shares a bunch of career tips for students on how to prepare yourself for your first data science job, and shares some great resources throughout the episode.
