For [_Episode 016_ of Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast/episode-016), I had a great time interviewing [Ben Lewis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-lewis-ba379144/), Business Intelligence Analyst at MeridianLink. Ben and I met at a hackathon hosted by the Orange County R Users Group ("OCRUG") and I was immediately impressed by his R skills. He has an Industrial Engineering and Operations Research background from the University of California, Berkeley, and as a BI Analyst at MeridianLink, he regularly programs in R for analytics, dashboards, and Shiny web-apps. Ben is an active member of the Southern California data science community, he regularly attends and volunteers at OCRUG, and he shares resources and tips for students and practitioners.

Bonus: MeridianLink is hiring and looking to add dashboard developers. If you like what you hear, feel free to reach out to Ben.
