I am still out of the country and enjoying time away from the computer... Apologies for your patience and Scatter Podcast will be back _SOON_ with fresh content. This is a replay of [an episode](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast/episode-011) that I released in May with [Vince Giovannini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincegiovannini/), Data Scientist at CBRE. For those of you not familiar with this company, CBRE is 100+ year-old commercial real estate investment company that offers a wide range of real estate consulting services. Vince works in the Labor Analytics team at CBRE and shares great insights about the labor products he has worked on and how labor is connected to real estate economics. Vince shares several project examples that he's been a part of at CBRE and it was great getting to hear how his firm uses data science to derive deeper insights.
