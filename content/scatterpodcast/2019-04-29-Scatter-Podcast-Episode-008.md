On [Episode 008 of Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast/episode-008), I interview guest [Taranveer Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taranveer/) and discuss his work as a Data Scientist at [Chegg](https://www.chegg.com/). Through natural language processing ("NLP") and data science, Taran's team provides Chegg customers with a better user experience, ensuring the customer voice is heard. Chegg operates fast and smart, and data science enables the business to quickly research and deploy product features that are most desired by their community.
