On [Episode 010 of Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast/episode-010), I'm excited to host guest [Ryan Anderson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theryananderson/), Director of Performance Marketing & Analytics at FortyFour. FortyFour is an independent digital agency based in Atlanta, GA, and Ryan leads their analytics team. Ryan, a Georgia Institute of Technology engineering and MBA alum, was a driving force for me diving into analytics and data science (thank you!).

Ryan has been a great sounding board the past couple of years and he's a wealth of knowledge on analytics and digital strategies. He has great perspectives about being data-informed, and shares solid resources for careers in digital analytics. Enjoy the episode, and to stay connected with Ryan, signup for his email newsletter (I highly recommend it)!
