I am on a flight en route back to the U.S., vacation was nice and sad it is over. BUT, excited to push out some new content starting _NEXT WEEK_! This week, I'm re-broadcasting the sixth episode of Scatter Podcast with [Juan Pablo Murillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juanpablomurillo/), Data Scientist at T-Mobile. Juan Pablo is based at T-Mobile's U.S. headquarters in Bellevue, WA (greater Seattle area). Mathematics instructor turned data scientist, Juan Pablo is in customer analytics and works with engineering and analytics teams to improve the T-Mobile and MetroPCS customer experience. He has been a solid data science mentor for me over the last few months, reviewing, rating, and critiquing some of my R code, and providing constructive feedback. Sharp guy and I'm excited to share his data analytics passion with others!
