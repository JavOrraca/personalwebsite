For [_Episode 017_ of Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast/episode-017), I interviewed [Justin Fortier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-fortier-4563554/), Principal Data Scientist at ViralGains. Justin and I met at the Data Science GO conference in 2018 and I enjoyed getting to learn about his journey as a data scientist. ViralGains is a video advertising technology startup that helps publishers push video ad content to the most appropriate consumers. Given that ViralGains operates within the real-time bidding ("RTB") domain, their ad bidding and classification algorithms need to transact and process within 100 milliseconds. Justin explains the classification models that he relies on, he provides an overview of RTB, and he discusses AdTech concerns around fraud. It was a pleasure to have him on the show. Keep up with his conference presentations and podcast appearances by following him on LinkedIn and enjoy the episode!
