Having just graduated, my podcast is on hiatus as I take a much needed vacation, so, I'm sharing a prior interview that I did with [Rafi Kurlansik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphaelkurlansik/) of Databricks. I like [this episode](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast/episode-005) because it provides a different perspective on data science careers: Doing proof of concepts to support pre-sales or technical sales. The work keeps you continuously learning and your clients can be wide-ranging in size and industry. I met Rafi in 2018 when he was at IBM Watson Cloud Studio and he joined the Databricks team in Jan 2019. He's an incredibly talented R user and I hope that you like the episode!
