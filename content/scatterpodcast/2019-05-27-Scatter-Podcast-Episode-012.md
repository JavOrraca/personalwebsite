On [Episode 012 of Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast/episode-012), I interview [Matt Segal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/segalmatt/), Data Director at TBWA/Chiat/Day, a global creative advertising agency. Chiat/Day gained global notoriety with their "1984" ad campaign for Apple introducing the Macintosh computer. Their forward-thinking and disruptive style make for a unique place to work as a data strategist, and Matt discusses the benefits of data careers at advertising agencies. Matt shares recent project examples his data team has been involved with, he discusses tools regularly used for social listening and web analytics, and he shares solid resources for those of you interested in this space. Enjoy the episode!
