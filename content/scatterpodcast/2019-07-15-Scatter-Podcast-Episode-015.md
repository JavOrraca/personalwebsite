On [Episode 015 of Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast/episode-015), I had the pleasure of interviewing [Meltem Ballan, Ph.D.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meltemballan/), Data Scientist and Architect at General Motors. Meltem's deep analytical and data science expertise developed over her 20 years of experience in academia, consulting, and the corporate world. In fact, before "data science" became a catchphrase, Meltem was referred to as an algorithm developer.

At GM, Meltem's team aims to enhance the driver experience where she applies neuroscience theory to analyze massive data sets via machine learning and artificial intelligence. Meltem provides great tips and resources for data science students and enthusiasts, and it's great to hear what she does on a day-to-day basis. Enjoy the show!
